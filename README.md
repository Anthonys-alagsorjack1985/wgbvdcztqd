Oh man, O'Dessa, what a freakin' ride. Just stumbled out of the theater, and my brain feels like it's been tossed through a blender set to epic saga. Okay, where do I even start? Am I more tired or more amazed? Maybe both. Definitely both. It’s like that weird energy you get when you’re sleepy but can't stop thinking about a dream you had. You know, when you keep replaying scenes in your head but they come out all jumbled and mismatched. Yeah, that.

First of all, my back is killing me from those damn theater seats, and I’m way too old to sit through  s that long without fidgeting. And for what? Some bizarre tale of... what was it again? A land trapped between the sun and your own stupid choices? Yeah, that sounds about right. Taking you through this wild crapstorm of feels where you're not even sure if you're rooting for the right guy 'cause everyone’s got like, questionable morals and killer hair swoops.

Gotta admit though, the visuals punched me straight in the eyeball. I mean it was color — and then more color, and then here’s another layer of color for your face. It kind of felt like being forced to eat an entire birt𝘏𝘋ay cake yourself... in one sitting. But, you know, you regret nothing because it was beautiful going down. Or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, whatever. There’s this one scene where the dude’s standing on a cliff, shouting to the sky, and I was like, “Bro, you are one Instagram post away from being the poster child for dramatic meltdowns.” That’s the scene you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for, so your friends get how deep it is.

> And the music. Oh lordy, it’s like someone let a piano and a dying whale have a heartfelt chat, and I still don’t know if I was the one crying or if it was just the sound system. I think at one point I actually whispered queen under my breath and scared the dude next to me half to death.

Let’s talk acting. Everyone’s doing their darnedest to stir up emotions like a barista on a caffeine high making latte art. That main actor, he’s got a face like a rusty old jigsaw puzzle that somehow fits together with enough squinting. But ugh, by the ending, they really twisted my brain into a pretzel. Can we just agree that whatever moral the   had is still lost somewhere in that theater?

document.getElementById(odessa).innerHTML = what just happened?;

I guess that’s what  s are for, right? To make you feel all scrambled and tossed and kinda alive all at once. Next time though, I’m bringing popcorn that hasn't been sitting there since the Jurassic era. But hey, credit where credit’s due, they certainly knew how to twist a story around enough to make you walk out wondering if you should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to untangle the mess. Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, so much for a simple   night.
